## Monday
- made the first draft for the ispa poster took most of the day
- purchased the rest of the travel items like the hotel
- sent out reciepts to everyone who needed them

## Tuesday
- started really working on figuring oout what i will be doing for the next stint of this project
- i did a literature review today and would add stuff to the paper i am working on for this project
- i read this article on the new xlstm architecture https://medium.com/@zergtant/deep-dive-into-xlstm-the-evolution-of-lstm-architecture-and-pytorch-code-implementation-d901a14bbcec
- i think that currently the xlstm architecture may yield to be valuable to have in the context of what we are working the residual block that prevend  gradienct explosion although are designed for being abhle to make the model deeper thy will probably yield valuue for us too.
- i realized that part of my data is incorrectly structured so i am going to fix that
- it took a lot of work but i got the dataset corrsectly shaped for the lstm training
- i added a 4x increase in data by augmenting it with some noise
- improved the documentation of the dataset creation file
- improved the documentation of the data readme log
- created a new directory to save all graphic visualizations to
- finished editing the poster 

## Wednesday
- read through [papers/Understanding LSTM – a tutorial into Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks.pdf](<../../papers/Understanding LSTM – a tutorial into Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks.pdf>)
- read trough [(<../../papers/Investigating the Relationship Between Climate and Valley Fever (Coccidioidomycosis).pdf>)](<../../papers/Investigating the Relationship Between Climate and Valley Fever (Coccidioidomycosis).pdf>)
- read through [papers/The Rise of Valley Fever Prevalence and Cost Burden of Coccidioidomycosis Infection in California.pdf](<../../papers/The Rise of Valley Fever Prevalence and Cost Burden of Coccidioidomycosis Infection in California.pdf>)
- read trough [papers/xLSTM- Extended Long Short-Term Memory.pdf](<../../papers/xLSTM- Extended Long Short-Term Memory.pdf>)
-watched a video on xLSTM to understand it even further
- made edits to my paper
- built a linear regressor
- build a lstm 

## Thursday


## Friday 


## Saturday 

## Sunday


## TODO
- clean up and organize the dataset creation notebook
- send the poster off to get printed
- send mary the reciept for the poster
- get what size mary is for her hoodie - medium
- train using dropout and without dropout
