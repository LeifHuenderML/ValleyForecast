## Monday
- finished writing the fast pitch
- added more documentation to the scltm block
- added more docutmenation to the mlstm block
- added more documentation to the xlstm block
- finalized the fast pitch shematics to better go wit the speech i wrote
- wrote the training loop funciton for the xlstm
- started debugging the code for the xlstm
- wrote a Lego class that stacks the blocks for the lstm in a very easy to define way
- wrote a grid search algoritm that will search hidden layer parameter sizes and save the best result
- wrote the first draft to the abstract of the paper
- made the template for the poster



## Tuesday
- started working through debugging the code
- i was running into a lot of issues some were over my head so i started looking around at other programers solutions
- this is the least messy xlstm repo i found https://github.com/muditbhargava66/PyxLSTM
- there are issuse with it though so i am rewriting it to be better and fix any issues with testing on our own data
- the rewrite took most of the day but it was a great learning experience seeing how someone else interpretted the xlstm paper line by line.

## TODO

- try to find efficiencies with the slstm and mlstm
- get the xlstm training 
- experiment with different architecture variants with the xlstm
- run the xlstm through the grid search too
- continue writing the paper and compile results
