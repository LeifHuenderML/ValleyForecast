## Thursday
- A lot of the work for today was dedicated to getting work done for my previous project on similarity scoring microclimates
- downloaded the dataset for the california valley fever 
- started making different visualizations of that data 
- cleaned the dataset 
- i found a handfull of counties where there is a zero count for cases i am putting a pin in it to wait ans see how accurate the records are before moving forward to see as to why this is the case i created a new dataset where i removed any county from the df where there was more than 60 of the data marked as a zero, my reasoning is that if they are marked at zero it is more likely due to improper data collection than there actually being no cases but i do want to see it this reasoning is correct. 
- create the structure for the valleyforecast repo

- collect papers and look to answer research questions
- create an outline for the next paper
- with the lstm model i want to try training a few batches one on the season leading up to the cases
- try training on unaggergated data
- try trainning on aggregated data
