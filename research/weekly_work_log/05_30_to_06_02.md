## Thursday
- A lot of the work for today was dedicated to getting work done for my previous project on similarity scoring microclimates
- downloaded the dataset for the california valley fever 
- started making different visualizations of that data 
- cleaned the dataset 
- wrote a research outline and prospectives for the next 8 weeks 
- created the structure for the valleyforecast repo
- focusing on better documentation for this projlect since there is less of a time demand
- so the original dataset contained 64 unique counties but not all of them should be included because some of them are totals of multiple counties plus that would cost 640$ to purchasse all that data
