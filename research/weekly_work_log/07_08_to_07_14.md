## TODO
- experiment with different architecture variants with the xlstm
- run the xlstm through the grid search too
- continue writing the paper and compile results
- update the graphs for the poster, and create them into one figure for the poster do this in canva
- create a loss graph of the accuracy over time that plots the lstm xltsm and the mlp on it
- crete the math forward passes for the paper
- edit the paper based on the improvements reccomended
- read through more research papres for wrtining the paper
- update the poster to johns reccomendations
- get the new poster printed
