## Monday
- tweaked the xlstm class to alow for variants to the stack config
- implemented a custom gridsearch for searching xlstm variants
- started the runn of the grid search it will take all week to completer
- worked more on the paper
- created the lstm diagram
- created the slstm diagram
- created the mlstm diragram
-created the xlstm diagram
- worked on the poster

## Tuesday
- created the aggregated weather graph 
- created the choroplot of the valley fever cases in california
- made a lot of changes to the poster
- added the graphs to the paper
- started bringing the paper from word to overleaf for better editing the maths
- reformatted all the refreences to be in the proper order
- ran the paper through grammarly
- imported the whole paper into overleaf now i just have to format it better
- imported the graphs to the paper in overleaf
- wrote all the math equations/formulas into latex
- began reformatting more, latex is very time consuming

## Wednesday
- reformatted the mathe equations to all have a similar style
- created additional graphs
- there was an error with the grid search so i had to restart that 
- edited the paper for spelling and grammatical mistakes
- finally got it all the figures to wrap nicely into the paper
- added captions to all the figures
- proofread the paper several times
- added the new graphs to the poster
- edited the diagrams to make them more clear

## Thursday
## Friday 
## Saturday
## Sunday



## TODO
- experiment with different architecture variants with the xlstm
- run the xlstm through the grid search too
- continue writing the paper and compile results
- update the graphs for the poster, and create them into one figure for the poster do this in canva
- create a loss graph of the accuracy over time that plots the lstm xltsm and the mlp on it
- crete the math forward passes for the paper
- edit the paper based on the improvements reccomended
- read through more research papres for wrtining the paper
- update the poster to johns reccomendations
- get the new poster printed
