## TODO
- added in documentation
- split the dataset into train validation and test datasets
- build a base reg to run on the train and test datasets
- built a lstm to train on the train val and test datasets
- build a gridsearch to find the best hyperparameters for a lstm
- add a feature to the gridsearch that will log all the tested paraameters into a csv, i want to store each parameter, train time, model size, train rmse, validation rmse, test rmse
- run the gridsearch searching for the best set of hyperparameters with the regular lstm
- build the xlstm
- get the xlstm training 
- run the xlstm through the grid search too
