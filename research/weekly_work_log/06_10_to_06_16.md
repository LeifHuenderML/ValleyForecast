## TODO
- write a summray of the work i am on now, sent that, my github and contact info to mary
- change the dataset to include the whole years weather patterns


- build a gridsearch to find the best hyperparameters for a lstm
- add a feature to the gridsearch that will log all the tested paraameters into a csv, i want to store each parameter, train time, model size, train rmse, validation rmse, test rmse
- run the gridsearch searching for the best set of hyperparameters with the regular lstm
- build the xlstm
- get the xlstm training 
- run the xlstm through the grid search too
