# Research questions

- is there a direct link to valley fever and weather _: yes it was shown in the paper papers/A_Deep_Learning_Approach_to_Predict_Weather_Data_Using_Cascaded_LSTM_Network.pdf
- is this proven : yes
- is it causal  : no they used lin reg so there is now determinality of causality 

- are zero case locations irrelavent or relevant = for our purposes they are if there is more than 60% zero cases in a locations meaning that theere is more likely just not good data on it
