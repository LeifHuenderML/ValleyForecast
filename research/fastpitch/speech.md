What's steadily increasing each year and costing US citizens millions? No, not just inflation - I'm talking about something called Valley Fever.
Valley Fever is a fungal infection you can get by breathing in spores from soil in dry areas like California and Arizona. In California alone, it has cost over $700 million to treat. And I thought my last dental visit was expensive!
This summer, I worked on a project to predict Valley Fever cases using weather data and artificial intelligence. The goal? To create a more accurate forecasting tool than what we currently have. And no it is not Chat GPT.
Here's how it works:

We feed weather data and past Valley Fever cases into a smart computer program.
The program, which uses something called a Long Short-Term Memory network (or LSTM for short), learns patterns between weather and Valley Fever outbreaks.
It then predicts future cases based on new weather data.

Now, you might be wondering, "What's this LSTM thing?" Think of it as the program's memory. Just like how you remember important events in your life but forget what you had for lunch last Tuesday, the LSTM learns to keep important weather patterns and forget the less relevant ones. This helps it make better predictions over time.
Our AI model, powered by this LSTM architecture, outperforms traditional methods by up to 87%. That's a big improvement!
Why does this matter? Well, with better predictions, we can:

Help budget committees prepare financially for outbreaks
Warn the public in high-risk areas
Give scientists new insights to study and prevent Valley Fever

In short, we're using cutting-edge AI technology to tackle a growing health problem. By predicting Valley Fever outbreaks more accurately, we can better protect our communities and potentially save millions in healthcare costs.
Thank you for your time. I hope you found this both informative and, dare I say, a little less stuffy than your average fungal infection talk!
