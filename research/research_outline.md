## moving forward 
- try to find more explainability between different weather patterns and cm
- there is a kaiser dataset on this
- try to group it down by climate areas to find what climate areas matter
- there is a dataest on Readil available published dataset from marissa childs
- if i could find when and where to sample that would be valuable
- if i could find correlation to air particulate matter that would be good
