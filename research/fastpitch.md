What’s steadily increasing each year and costing US citizens millions? I know you’re probably thinking inflation. You’d be right, but that’s not what I’m here to discuss today. Instead, let’s talk about something far more sinister... wait for laughter... Valley Fever, also known as Coccidioidomycosis. It's a fungal infection caused by inhaling spores of the Coccidioides fungus found in the soils of arid regions like California and Arizona. Recent studies have shown that in California alone, combating and treating Valley Fever costs over $700 million each year. And I thought my last dental visit was expensive... wait for laughter... This summer, I embarked on a mission to devise a way to accurately forecast the number of Valley Fever cases based solely on weather data. My goal was to build a model using AI that is more precise than previous methods. This model aims to better equip and inform the scientific community and the public about how severe the outbreak might be each year. Here’s how the system works: I collect weather data from a specific location, along with the documented number of Valley Fever cases from that year. This data is fed into the model, which then predicts the number of cases for the following year. Now, let's talk about the magic behind the scenes—the Long Short-Term Memory network, or LSTM. Imagine the weather data as a series of events happening over time. The LSTM processes this sequence step-by-step, retaining important information and forgetting the irrelevant details. This process is known as the forward pass. During the forward pass, each weather data point is fed into the LSTM cell. The LSTM has three main components that control its memory: the forget gate, the input gate, and the output gate. The forget gate decides what information from the previous state should be discarded. It looks at the current input and the previous output and produces a number between 0 and 1 for each piece of information in the cell state. A 0 means "completely forget" and a 1 means "completely keep." The input gate decides what new information should be stored in the cell state. It updates the cell state with new information from the current input and the previous output. Finally, the output gate determines what the next hidden state should be. This hidden state is then used for the next time step in the sequence and also serves as the output of the LSTM for the current time step. The LSTM repeats this process for each weather data point, effectively learning the patterns and dependencies in the data over time. Each prediction is compared to the actual data, and the model learns from its mistakes through a process called backpropagation through time. This cycle continues, refining the model's accuracy. After many iterations, the model's performance plateaus, indicating that it has learned all it can from the data. That's when we stop training, resulting in a finely tuned model that can outperform traditional methods by up to 87% on the data we tested. With this model, we can now forecast how severe Valley Fever incidences could be in any area based solely on that year's weather data. This has several practical applications: Budgetting commitiees can use these forecasts to allocate financial resources more effectively, ensuring they are prepared for potential outbreaks. It can also be used to increase public awareness by informing them about expected case numbers, we can better prepare individuals, especially those in high-risk areas. Finally it provides the scientific community with valuable insights into the relationship between microclimates and Valley Fever, potentially paving the way for further research and better preventive measures. Thank you, everyone! It’s been great sharing this with you, and I hope you found it both informative and, dare I say, a little entertaining.
