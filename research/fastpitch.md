What is steadily increasing each year and costing US citizens millions. I know you are probably thinking inflation. You would be right but that is not what i will be going over today ... wait for laughter... . Coccidoidomycosis also known as valley fever is a fungal infection caused by inhaling the spores of the Coccidioides fungus found in the soil of arid regions like california and arizona. As of recent studies they have found that each year in california alone it is costing over $ 700 million to fight and treat this issue. And i thought my last dental visit was expensive... wait for laughter ... Over this sumeer i worked on devising a way to accurately forecast the number of cocci incidences based only on weather data. My goal was to build a model using AI that is more accurate than previous methods in order to better equip and inform the scientific community and the public over how bad the rates may be this year. In order to develop a baseline for understanding how performant my models were I created a dummy regressor which will alwarys predict the mean value based on the training data. On the left you can cee a visulization of the number of cases a county has experienced over a 21 year span. The darker the color the more cases. in the middle you can see how well the baseline understood what was going on in that 20 year span. Now on the right is the model that i channelled the main part of my research into, i collected daily weather updates for each county over that 21 year spand and fed tht to what is called a Long short term memory network, give a raise of hands if you know what that is? ... wait.. i see x ... thats great, well a long short term memory netowrk or lstm for short is a very interestin model in ai it is exceptional at understaning how
