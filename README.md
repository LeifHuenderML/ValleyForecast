# ValleyForecast

## Introduction
Welcome to the official repository for the ValleyForecast project, a  research initiative worked on by Leif Huender, a research fellow at the University of Idaho, in collaboration with Dr. Mary Everett. This repository contains the source code, documentation, and related resources developed during our summer research project focused on predictive modeling for Valley fever outcomes based on meteorological data.

## Project Overview
**Valley fever**, scientifically known as **coccidioidomycosis**, is a fungal infection caused by *Coccidioides* spp., primarily affecting lung health. This research project aimed to develop an advanced predictive model utilizing Enhanced Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) networks to forecast the incidence of Valley fever based on yearly weather cycles. By integrating comprehensive meteorological data, our model seeks to provide early insights that could be crucial for healthcare preparedness and response strategies.

## Repository Structure
- **/src**: Contains all source codes developed for the project.
- **/data**: This directory holds datasets used and generated during the project. (Note: Due to privacy and data protection laws, access to raw data may require additional permissions.)
- **/docs**: Documentation related to the project, including research papers, findings, and a detailed explanation of methodologies.
- **/research**: Includes additional resources like extended abstracts, presentations, and related literature.
- **/graphs**: Includes all the graphs that were generated during the project

## Key Results
The model developed through this project has demonstrated strong capabilities in predicting the likely incidence of Valley fever with significant accuracy, which could potentially assist in mitigating the impact through better preparedness and timely interventions.
